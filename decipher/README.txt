Compile with g++ ie: g++ q1.cc
run with a.out (filename) ie: a.out problem1.enc
If you want to output the output into a file, stream it to a file.
ie: a.out problem1.enc >> output.txt

To change the size of the matrix, edit the line const int n = x
and const in m = y

Set x and y as the numbers for the n x m matrix.
